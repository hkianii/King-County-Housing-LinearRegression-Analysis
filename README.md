# Multiple Linear Regression with Interaction: King County House Prices

## Project Overview
This project was developed as part of a class assignment focusing on practical applications of Multiple Linear Regression with interactions. Utilizing the King County House Data, our analysis aims to understand the factors influencing the rising house prices in the local area. This project is intended to provide real-world insights by applying theoretical knowledge from our coursework.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis, `kc_house_data.csv`, represents housing sales in King County. It includes features such as the number of bedrooms, square footage, and sale price. This dataset was chosen for its relevance to our local community and the current concerns regarding housing affordability.

## Analysis
The core of our analysis lies in constructing a Multiple Linear Regression model, incorporating interaction terms to explore the combined effects of different housing features on sale prices. The R programming language, along with various packages like `corrplot`, `gridExtra`, and `Metrics`, was used to perform this analysis.

## How to Run
1. Ensure R and the necessary packages (`corrplot`, `gridExtra`, `Metrics`) are installed on your machine.
2. Download the `Group7_Hung_Huang_Ijaz_Kiani_DA310_FinalProject.R` and `kc_house_data.csv` files from this repository.
3. Place both files in the same directory.
4. Open the R script in your R environment and run it to replicate our analysis and view the results.


## Results and Discussion

Given the data and context provided from your R script and the CSV dataset, here is a revised "Results and Discussion" section incorporating more nuanced findings and relating them to broader economic and development considerations:

Results and Discussion

Our analysis using a Multiple Linear Regression model reveals key factors influencing house prices in King County. The findings not only corroborate common real estate maxims, such as the premium on larger homes and scenic views, but also underline deeper socio-economic dynamics:

Size and Price Correlation: Confirming our hypothesis, larger houses command higher prices. This relationship, while anticipated, has nuanced implications for urban development and housing affordability. As cities expand, this trend could drive lower-income residents towards smaller homes or further from city centers, exacerbating suburban sprawl and socio-economic segregation.

View Quality and Market Valuation: Properties with superior views attract premium prices, emphasizing the value placed on natural amenities. This premium can lead to uneven development, where areas with attractive landscapes become enclaves for the affluent, potentially sidelining community-oriented development and contributing to housing inequality.

Economic Development Insights: The distribution of housing prices and features like year built and renovations across different zip codes can inform us about historical and ongoing economic development trends within King County. Areas with rising housing prices might be witnessing economic growth, while stagnant or falling prices could indicate regions facing economic challenges.

Sustainability and Urban Planning: Our findings suggest a demand for features that might not always align with sustainable development goals, such as large lot sizes and waterfront properties. This highlights the need for urban planning policies that balance development desires with environmental sustainability.

Affordability and Development Policy: The clear correlation between housing characteristics and prices underscores the importance of thoughtful development policies to ensure housing remains accessible to a broad demographic. The rising costs associated with desirable features like larger size and better views necessitate policies that support a variety of housing options to maintain diverse, inclusive communities.

These insights extend beyond the academic exercise, reflecting real-world challenges faced by King County residents. They underscore the importance of integrating housing affordability and equitable development into the broader economic framework, ensuring that growth benefits a wide spectrum of the population. As we delve further into the data and expand our analysis, these initial findings serve as a foundation for understanding the complex interplay between real estate markets, urban development, and socioeconomic factors.
